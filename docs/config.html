<h2>imgcomp configuration options</h2>

Imgcomp, under normal use, will run on a Raspberry Pi and launch raspistill to
capture images every second or so to a ramdisk.  Imgcomp monitors the ram disk,
comparing successive images and saving those images with changes from the previous
one to a folder hierarchy in flash.
<p>
Imgcomp can also be run on a series of images stored in a folder, as well as
compare two images specified on the command line.  These modes are primarily
used for development and diagnostics.
<p>
Parameters can be in a configuration file (imgcomp.conf) or on the command line.  Parameters
in imgcomp.conf are read first, and may be overridden by parameters on the command line.
<p>
Configuration file options are in the form of:
<p>
<div class="c">parameter = value</div>
<p>
<div class="p">scale</div>
How much to scale jpeg images by before running the detection algorithm.  Scaling the image
down makes the program run faster and less susceptible to pixel noise.  Scale value can be
1, 2, 4 or 8.  Default is 4.  I only use it with a scaling of 4 myself.
<p>
<div class="p">region</div>
Specifies what region of the image that detection is to be done over.
The region is specified as x1-x2,y1-y2.  For example 200-600,150-450 would specify
and area in the middle, and half the size of a 800x600 image.  By default, image detection
is over the entire image.  Note that these values will be scaled down along with the image
for the actual detection algorithm, so the region edges may not be precise to the pixel.

<div class="p">exclude</div>
Specifies a rectangular image to be excluded from detection.  The region is specified
in the format x1-x2,y1-y2, similar to "region".  If your detection region contains a lot
of excluded area, I recommend using the "diffmap" option instead.

<div class="p">diffmap</div>
Specifies the name of a jpeg file that is the map of a jpeg image.  Areas coloure
pure blue in the diffmap will be excluded from detection, and areas of pure red will
be twice as sensitive for detection.
Most natural images do not contain sufficiently red or blue areas
to be considered "ignore" or "double", so you can take a capture image and paint
areas to ignore (such as trees or waving flags) blue, and perhaps a doorway
in red.  The colours of the rest of the image are highly unlikely to be sufficiently
red or blue to hit the threshold for ignore or double sensitivity.
When imgcomp starts with a diffmap, it shows
(in text) which areas are ignore or high weight.

<div class="p">dodir</div>
Specifies which directory full of images to process.  This is for offline mode
(not using live captures using raspistill).  Source images are not deleted.

<div class="p">followdir</div>
Specifies a directory to process and monitor for new images.  As new images appear,
imgcomp processes them and deletes them.  an "aquire_cmd" option is normally used
with this mode to launch raspistill to continuously aquire new images.

<div class="p">aquire_cmd</div>
Indicates the command line to launch raspistill with.  This line will in turn have a lot
of options to pass to raspistill.  Potentially, you could have imgcomp run another
image aquisition program instead of raspistill.  The reason imgcomp launches raspistill is that it
will monitor that raspistill has not stalled.  Imgcomp will kill and re-launch raspistill
if it detects that image aquisition has stopped.  Imgcomp will also
check if the image has become too bright or too dim and re-launch raspistill so that
raspistill can re-do the auto exposure, because (raspistill will not make exposure adjustments
while capturing timelapse images.  The aquire_cmd parameter is only used in followdir
mode. 

<div class="p">savedir</div>
Specifies with directory to save images to.

<div class="p">savenames</div>
Output naming scheme.  Uses strftime to format the output name.  
May include '/' characters to put different images in different directories.
The default would be savenames="%m%d/%H/%m%d-%H%M%S".  This value causes
imgcomp to create a directory for every day and every hour, and save the images
with the naming scheme "MMDD-HHMMSS".  An image on July 20 at 11:50:58 would
be placed in 0720/11/0720-115058.  This name will be appended with a space and the
diff magnitude value of three digits.  In addition, if more than one image is
saved in the same second, the space in the name will be replaced with a, b, or c, etc.

<div class="p">sensitivity</div>
Indicates how sensitive the program is.  I typically use values around 100.  However,
this value is highly dependent on image resolution.

<div class="p">blink_cmd</div>
Raspistill can blink the LED on the raspberry pi camera module when it detects
motion.  It uses a separate program, compiled as blink_camera_led.  This program
needs to be setuid root to have sufficient privileges for manipulating the hardware I/O lines.

<div class="p">tl</div>
Specifies a timelapse interval, in seconds.  For example "tl=600" will cause raspistill
to save an image every ten minutes, regardless of whether motion was detected.  Timelapse
images will occur on multiples of the specified time.  "tl=3600" will save an image on the
hour every hour, or whichever image is the first image acquired after the start of an hour.

<div class="p">outfile</div>
Specified the output file to write an image of differences.  This option is ONLY used
in development and debugging.  The output image is on PPM format (uncompressed bitmap)

<div class="p">debug</div>
Output extra debugging information
