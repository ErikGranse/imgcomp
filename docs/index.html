<h2>What is imgcomp for?</h2>
The program "imgcomp" is for capturing long term motion triggered timelaps photographs
using a Raspberry Pi and camera module.  It's also useful for unattended
monitoring and surveilance.
<p>
Unlike the "motion" package, it is not intended to work likc a CCTV camera. 
Imgcomp was inspired by wildlife cameras - the sort that
is strapped to a tree in the woods to monitor what sort of wildlife
is present, and checked after a week or more to see what it captured.
I use such cameras but found that the passive infrared motion sensing of
these camers would often miss events, especially in winter.  Sometimes they would even
miss a tractor driving past the camera within five meters!

<h2>What imgcomp does not do</h2>
<li>Not for battery powered application.  It uses too much power.
<li>Does not capture video
<li>Does not work with USB web cameras (still frame capture is too slow)
<li>Has no user interface to speak of
<li>Is not for people unfamiliar with using Linux from the command line.
<p>
<b>
If you don't know how to edit configuration file, before asking me questions,
get very familiar with linux.  This might take you a few months.  There is plenty
about linux on the internet, please don't ask me for pointers.</b>

<h2>Compiling imgcomp</h2>
It is assumed that you have rapsian already installed on your Raspberry Pi.
<p>
I do not have a binary distribution for imgcomp.  Before using imgcomp, you will have
to compile it.
<p>
Imgcomp uses libjpeg.  Because I don't like external dependencies, I included
a stripped down version of libjpeg in the distribution.  You will have to compile
this first:<p>
<div class="c">cd libjpeg</div>
<div class="c">make</div>
<div class="c">cd ..</div><br>

This will take a few minutes.
Then go back into the main imgcomp directory and type:<p>
<div class="c">mkdir obj</div>
<div class="c">make</div><br>
This will compile imgcomp.

<p>
I recommend setitng up imgcomp to run as user "pi" in the directory /home/pi/imgcomp<br>
The program "raspistill" will run as user "pi", but for other accounts requires root
priviledges (for reasons I don't understand).  So just use the user id 'pi' and
avoid the hassle.

<h2>Setting up imgcomp to run on the raspberry pi</h2>
<h3>Enable camera module</h3>
Run raspi-config to enable the camera module<p>
You also need to make sure that your camera module is installed and functioning.
Take some pictures with raspistill to test.  Type:
<div class="c">raspistill -o foo.jpg"</div><br>
Then check that foo.jpg is an image of what the camera was pointed at.

<h3>Make a ram disk</h3>
Imgcomp uses raspistill to capture images to the file system.  To avoid wearing out
the flash card, it's best to capture to a ramdisk.  Make a 20 megabyte ramdisk
by adding the following line to the end of <div class="c">/etc/fstab</div>:
<div class="c">tmpfs   /ramdisk        tmpfs   nodev,nosuid,size=20M   0       0</div>
<p>

<h2>Setting up Camera LED blinking</h2>
imgcomp can optionally blink the camera module's LED when it detects motion.
If you wish to enable this, plese follow the steps below.

Disable normal function of the camera LED, add the following line to the end of
the file at 
<div class="c">/boot/config.txt</div>

<div class="c">disable_camera_led=1</div>

<a href="http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2013/05/how-to-disable-the-red-led-on-the-pi-camera-module/">
More on how to do this here</a>
<p>
imgcomp runs a separate program with root priviledges to blink the LED.
This program is compiled as "blinkc_camera_led" along with imgcomp.
You can test that this blinks the camera's LED by running blink_camera_led with
root priviledges with this command (which will promot you for your password)
<p>
<div class="c">sudo ./blink_camera_led</div>
<p>
blink_camera_led toggles the GPIO line that goes to the camera LED on the raspberry Pi model b+.
If you are using a model A, you will have to modify the file blink_camera_led.c to specify
the appropriate GPIO line, then recompile by typing "make".
<p>
Once you have made sure that blink_camera_led blinks the LED, you will have to change the owner
of the file to root and set the "setuid bit".  This will allow the program to run with administrator
proviledges even when invoked by a regular user.
<p>
<div class="c">sudo chown root blink_camera_led</div>
<div class="c">sudo chmod +s blink_camera_led</div>
<p>
After this, type "ls -l".  The blink_camera_led file should now be highlighted because it runs
with elevated priviledges.

<div class="c">-rwsr-sr-x 1 root pi   6702 Jun 11 16:13 blink_camera_led</div>

<h2>Disable on screen logo and screen blanking</h2>
These steps are not necessary, but I prefer to disable the raspberry pi logo at the top
of the screen (more room for text) and disabling screen blanking:

In the file /etc/kbd.config change:
<div class="c">BLANK_TIME=30</div>
to
<div class="c">BLANK_TIME=0</div>

Also change:

<div class="c">POWERDOWN_TIME=30</div>
to
<div class="c">POWERDOWN_TIME=0</div>
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=18200">see here</a>
<p><br>

To disable the pi logo on the console, to the file /boot/cmdline.txt add:
<div class="c">logo.nolog</a>
to the end of the line
