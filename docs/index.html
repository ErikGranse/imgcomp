<h2>What is imgcomp for?</h2>
The program "imgcomp" is for capturing long term motion triggered timelaps photographs
using a Raspberry Pi and camera module.  The intended use is unattended
monitoring and surveilance.
<p>
Unlike the "motion" package, it is not intended to work likc a CCTV camera. 
Imgcomp was inspired by wildlife cameras - the sort that
is left strapped to a tree in the woods to take picture of passing deer and other
wildlife, with the images retrieved at a later time.
I use such cameras but found that the passive infrared motion sensing of
these camers would often miss events, especially in winter.  Sometimes
they would even miss a tractor driving past the camera!
<P>
I wrote imcomp to monitor comings and goings at my rural proerty when I am
not there.  Unlike the wildlife cameras, itwill not miss anything.  However,
it cannot be run on battery, and unlike passive infrared, it will not
trigger in the dark.

<h2>What imgcomp does not do</h2>
<li>Not for battery powered application.  It uses too much power.
<li>Does not capture video
<li>Does not work with USB web cameras (still frame capture is too slow)
<li>Has no user interface to speak of
<li>Is not for people unfamiliar with using Linux from the command line.
<p>
<b>
If you don't know how to edit configuration file, before asking me questions,
get very familiar with linux.  This might take you a few months of study.
There is plenty about linux on the internet, please don't ask me for pointers.</b>

<h2>Compiling imgcomp</h2>
Imgcomp compiles using gcc on a raspberry PI computer.  It builds a
static stripped down version of "libjpeg" along with it.  Building of the library
is invoked automatically by the makefile.
<p>
To compile imcomp, go to the main directory (containing the .c files) and 
enter the command<p>
<b>make</b>
<p><br>
Imgcomp can also be compiled under windows using the microsoft visual C
compiler.  The windows build cannot be used with live image capture.  I use
it for development and debugging.


<h2>How imgcomp works</h2>
The imgcomp runs the raspberry pi camera capture program "raspistill" to capture
still pictures every second (up to 3 frames per second).  Raspistill then reads
the images, and if it detects a change from one image to the next, copies the image
to a more permanent directory, under a name that contains the date.
<p>
imgcomp tries to differentiate between important and unimportant changes.  Changes
that are localized to part of the image, are more important than changes that
happen to the whole image.  Slow changes (such as clouds moving in) tend to be ignored.

<h2>Compiling imgcomp</h2>

It is assumed that you have rapsian already installed on your Raspberry Pi.
<p>
I do not have a binary distribution for imgcomp.  Before using imgcomp, you will have
to compile it.  If you don't know what compiling a program is, then you will not
have much luck with other aspects of setting up imcomp.
<p>
Imgcomp uses libjpeg.  Because I don't like external dependencies, I included
a stripped down version of libjpeg in the distribution.  This will automatically
compile when you compile imgcomp.  Compiling everything will take a few minutes.
<p>
You can compile imgcomp by going into the imgcomp directory and typing:<br>
<div class="c">make</div><br>
This will compile imgcomp.

<p>
I recommend setitng up imgcomp to run as user "pi" in the directory /home/pi/imgcomp<br>
The program "raspistill" will run as user "pi", but for other accounts requires root
priviledges (for reasons I don't understand).  So just use the user id 'pi' and
avoid the hassle.

<h2>Setting up imgcomp to run on the raspberry pi</h2>
Most of the steps of setting up imcomp described below can be automated
by running the bash script<p>
<span class="c">setup-imgcomp</span>
<br>
This automates creating the ram disk, 


<h3>Enable camera module</h3>
Run raspi-config to enable the camera module<p>
You also need to make sure that your camera module is installed and functioning.
Take some pictures with raspistill to test.  Type:
<div class="c">raspistill -o foo.jpg"</div><br>
Then check that foo.jpg is an image of what the camera was pointed at.

<h3>Make a ram disk</h3>
Imgcomp uses raspistill to capture images to the file system.  To avoid wearing out
the flash card, it's best to capture to a ramdisk.  Make a 20 megabyte ramdisk
by adding the following line to the end of <span class="c">/etc/fstab</span> :
<div class="c">tmpfs   /ramdisk        tmpfs   nodev,nosuid,size=20M   0       0</div>
<p>
Note that /etc/fstab is only read at startup, so to make this ramdisk active,
you will have to reboot your raspberry pi.

     how to make this work on Raspberry Pi 2 -->

<h3>Setting up Camera LED blinking</h2>
imgcomp can optionally blink the camera module's LED when it detects motion.
If you wish to enable this, plese follow the steps below.

Disable normal function of the camera LED, add the following line to the end of
the file at <span class="c">/boot/config.txt</span>:

<div class="c">disable_camera_led=1</div>

<a href="http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2013/05/how-to-disable-the-red-led-on-the-pi-camera-module/">
More on how to do this here</a>
<p>
imgcomp runs a separate program with root priviledges to blink the LED.
This program is compiled as "blinkc_camera_led" along with imgcomp.
You can test that this blinks the camera's LED by running blink_camera_led with
root priviledges with this command (which will promot you for your password)
<p>
<div class="c">sudo ./blink_camera_led</div>
<p>
blink_camera_led toggles the GPIO line that goes to the camera LED on the raspberry Pi model b+.
If you are using a model A, you will have to modify the file blink_camera_led.c to specify
the appropriate GPIO line, then recompile by typing "make".
<p>
Once you have made sure that blink_camera_led blinks the LED, you will have to change the owner
of the file to root and set the "setuid bit".  This will allow the program to run with administrator
proviledges even when invoked by a regular user.
<p>
<div class="c">sudo chown root blink_camera_led</div>
<div class="c">sudo chmod +s blink_camera_led</div>
<p>
After this, type "ls -l".  The blink_camera_led file should show roughly like this<br>
<div class="c">-rwsr-sr-x 1 root pi   6702 Jun 11 16:13 blink_camera_led</div>
<br>
If your terminal program supports colour highlighting, this line will also be highlighted.
Its important that the file attributes "-rwsr-sr-x 1 root" should match what is shown here.
<p>
-->
<h3>Configure startup on boot</h3>
It's best if imgcomp will automatically start after a power failure.  The easiest way to do
this is to add a line to /etc/rc.local.  Add the following line near the end of rc.local,
just above the line that reads <span class="c">exit 0</span>
<p>
<div class="c">su - pi -c "/home/pi/imgcomp/imgcomp" &amp;</div>
<p>
This will cause imgcomp to run on startup.  The login prompt will also start, but will quickly
become hidden by all the output that imgcomp produces.  However, you will still be able to
log into the console by typing your username and password (though your typing will quickly
be obscured by all the output).  After logging in, type "killall -9 imgcomp" to kill
the program.  You can restart it by typing "imcomp/imgcomp &amp;" from the home directory.
Started this way, it will keep running even after you log out.


<h3>Disable screen blanking</h3>
To disable screen blanking in console mode:<br>

In the file /etc/kbd/config change:<p>
<span class="c">BLANK_TIME=30</span> to <span class="c">BLANK_TIME=0</span><br>
Also change:<br>
<span class="c">POWERDOWN_TIME=30</span> to <span class="c">POWERDOWN_TIME=0</span>
<br>

<h3>Disable on screen logo</h3>
I prefer to disable the raspberry pi logo at the top of the screen
to leave more room for text.  To disable the logo, add <span class="c">logo.nologo</span> to the end of the line
in the file <span class="c">/boot/cmdline.txt</span>.  The line should look like this:<p>
<small>dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait <b>logo.nologo</b></small>
