To do next:

Review relaunch logic for dark images

* Sample map images in documentation
* Mention about logging in to console with stuff printing somewhere


Future features:
* glitch detection for longer
* Option to not save pre and post event images?
* Image save rate liminting (raise threshold when too many aquired)
* Some sort of web image view interface
