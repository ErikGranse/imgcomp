To do next:
* Flesh out browser.cfg, use for realtime.
* Peers server pointers (browser.cfg)
* use canvas method instead of chracter graphics for actagrams

Future features:
* Calculate separate motion fatigues for luma and chroma (to better ignore shadows and trees)
* glitch detection for more than one frame?
* Option to not save pre and post event images?
* Image save rate liminting (raise threshold when too many aquired)
