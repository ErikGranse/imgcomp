To do next:

Review relaunch logic for dark images

* LED configuration for PI2 
* Sample map images in documentation
* How detection works (threshold levels, contrast scaling, diff window)
* Uses exif, what if no exif?
* move source code to src directory
* Mention about logging in to console with stuff printing somewhere
